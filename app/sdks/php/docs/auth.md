# Auth Service

## Login

Please notice that in order to avoid a [Redirect Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) the only valid redirect URLs are the ones from domains you have set when adding your platforms in the console interface.
