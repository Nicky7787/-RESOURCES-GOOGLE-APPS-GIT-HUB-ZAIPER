## Getting Started

Initialise the Appwrite SDK in your code, and setup your API credentials:

```js

// Init your JS SDK
var appwrite = new Appwrite();

appwrite
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Set only when using self-hosted solution
    .setProject('455x34dfkj') // Your Appwrite Project UID
;

```
