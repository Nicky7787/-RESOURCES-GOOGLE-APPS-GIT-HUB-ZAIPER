The database service allows you to create structured document collections, query and filter lists of documents, and manage an advanced set of read and write access.

All the data in the database service is stored in JSON format. The service also allows you to nest child documents and use advanced filters to search and query the database just like you would with a classic graph database.

By leveraging the database permission management, you can assign read or write access to the database documents for a specific user, team, user role, or even grant public access to all visitors to your project.
