The authentication service allows you to verify users' accounts using basic email and password login or with a supported OAuth provider. The auth service also exposes methods to confirm users' email account and recover users forgotten passwords.

You can review and enable our currently available OAuth providers from your project console under the **'users -> providers'** menu.
