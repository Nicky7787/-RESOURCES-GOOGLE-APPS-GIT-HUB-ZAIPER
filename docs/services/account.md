The account service allows you to fetch and update information related to the currently logged-in user. You can use the service to retrieve a list of all the user sessions across different devices and a security log with the recent account activity.

Using the account service, you can also allow the logged-in user to update his account name, email, or passwords.

This service also exposes an endpoint to save and read [user preferences](/docs/account#updatePrefs) as a key-value object. This feature is handy if you want to allow extra customization in your app. Common usage for this feature may include saving the user preferred locale, timezone, or custom app theme. The usage of this feature is only limited only by your imagination.
